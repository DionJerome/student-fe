# Getting Started with a React App

To find documentation on how to build a React App follow this documentation -> [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

Once you have a React App created.\
You will have these scripts to build and run the app.\
Within the terminal of the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn start`

This will compile your project and should open a browser window to [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).

If no browser window opens, go to a broswer of your choosing and open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any errors in the console.

### `ctrl-c`

Use this command in the terminal of the project directory to stop running your React App.
